currently experimenting with high-level, highly interoperable bindings to Algorithmia APIs.

The end goal is still a bit fuzzy, but looking to have experimental answers to questions like:

- What does it look like to provide a few dozen highly-ergonomic, incredibly intuitive API wrappers that require almost no understanding of how the API works? (e.g. `File` instead of `Data URI`))
- Where is there common ground in APIs that can be abstracted over? Are there collections of APIs that follow patterns that I can exploit? (e.g. variety of image taggers)
- Is it possible to generate large portions of the interfaces and required conversions? Is there missing semantic information that would make this better?
- and a few other questions...
